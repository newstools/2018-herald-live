Closing arguments in the formal bail application of six people accused of stabbing a teenager to death during the opening of the season festivities last month will only be heard on Friday. Legal representatives for the accused, aged between 15 and 20, had previously told the Port Elizabeth Magistrateâ€™s Court that their respective clients intended to plead not guilty to the charge of murder. On Monday, investigating officer Detective Constable John Leppan testified that Curtleigh Alexander, 16, was chased to the Hobie Beach parking lot in the early hours of December 17, where he was thrown to the ground, kicked and stabbed twice. Three of the accused cannot be named as they are minors. Leppan told magistrate Sanjani Naidoo that he did not oppose bail for the three minors or their co-accused Faizel Davids, 20 and Fergil Fillis, 19. Leppan told the court that Shuaib Slabbert, 18, of Arcadia had handed himself over to police, telling them that he had stabbed Alexander. Leppan said Slabbert was responsible for the death and should not be granted bail because he might intimidate state witnesses.
