The matric class of 2017 have achieved a pass rate of 75.1%‚ up from 72.5% the previous year. This is still down from a peak of 78.2% of matriculants who passed in 2013. The figure reflects the achievement of the 401 435 matriculants who passed their National Senior Certificate exams‚ Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said on Thursday evening. To obtain a National Senior Certificate‚ a candidate must achieve at least 40% in three subjects‚ one of which is an official language at Home Language level‚ and 30% in three other subjects. A failure of a home language will mean the matriculant fails. Just over 28% of pupils achieved a pass that will allow them to go to university.
