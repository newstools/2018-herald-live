Eskom has warned that there is a high probability of stage-two load shedding for up to 13 hours on Friday. The cash-strapped power utility said the likelihood of load shedding on a wider scale than experienced on Thursday was as a result of the “loss of additional units overnight”. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said on Thursday that stage-one rotational power cuts had to be rolled out from midday due to “unplanned outages”. Eskom chairman Jabu Mabuza said on Wednesday that the power utility had seen a steady decline in plant performance and coal supply‚ which threatened its ability to keep the lights on‚ reported BusinessLIVE.
