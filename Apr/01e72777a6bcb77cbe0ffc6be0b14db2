It is with deep sorrow that we learnt of the passing away of Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the veteran of our struggle and mother of the nation. The people of South Africa and the whole world have lost a gallant fighter for freedom for her people, a remarkable mother, a champion of justice and peace in our country. She was the face of the fight against the oppressive dispensation of the white minority regime and its exploitation of the black masses. Besides, she was also the symbol of the peaceful transition of South Africa from a police state to a free democratic state, the “rainbow nation”. We shall remember her unwavering fighting spirit and unfettered bold resilience against the apartheid regime with all its atrocities. Madikizela-Mandela did not only inspire our people to fight against apartheid, but she also inspired the whole world in support of the anti-apartheid struggle. The sad loss of this selfless freedom fighter should prompt each of us and our organisation to introspect regarding the principles and values which she espoused, namely honesty, humility, peace and integrity.
