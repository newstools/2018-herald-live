Nelson Mandela Bay’s ambulance service’s phone lines that were not working early on Thursday, are back online. The metro’s head of emergency medical services, Brenhan Metune, said heavy rain had knocked out the server at the ambulance call centre in Lindsay Road, Korsten. The server has been restored.
