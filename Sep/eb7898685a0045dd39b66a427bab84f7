A former DA activist who accused former mayor Athol Trollip of bribery was found guilty of defamation and making a false statement in the Port Elizabeth Magistrateâ€™s Court. Passing down judgement on Friday, magistrate Pumla Sibiya said Nontuthuzelo Jack, 47, had altered her version of events as the case progressed and that the state had proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. Jack alleged Trollip tried to bribe her to dig up dirt on former DA provincial chair Veliswa Mvenya prior to the 2016 local elections. Sibiya found that evidence before court that Trollip was in Port Alfred during the time he was alleged to have bribed Jack was true and that allegations that he used a friend's light aircraft to fly to Port Elizabeth were baseless and had no merit. Jack will be sentenced on October 4.
