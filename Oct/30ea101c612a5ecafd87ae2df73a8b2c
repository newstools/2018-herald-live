The ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay has been disbanded following a meeting of the party’s Provincial Executive Committee on Monday. ANC provincial secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi made the announcement at a press conference on Tuesday. The Nelson Mandela Bay Regional Executive Committee (REC) is one of three in the province discussed at Monday's meeting. Two other regions - the OR Tambo and Joe Gqabi regions, both of which were long overdue to hold their conferences - were dissolved. Nelson Mandela Bay was disbanded for, among other reasons, the REC’s failure to convene a regional general council to appoint a chairman after Andile Lungisa was told to vacate the position.
