Kaizer Chiefs named Ernst Middendorp as their new coach after dismissing both their head coach Giovanni Solinas and his assistant Patrick Mabedi following a string of poor results in 2018-2019 campaign. Chiefs released the Solinas bombshell news on their Twitter account on Friday afternoon. A little while later the club confirmed the appointment of Middendorp, who will be back for a second spell at Chiefs. “We were looking for a coach who is experienced and who has an understanding of the club’s footballing culture,” said chairman Kaizer Motaung  on the Chiefs website. “That’s certainly the case with Middendorp, who won trophies during his previous stint in charge of Kaizer Chiefs. “Middendorp also understands South African football well, having a vast knowledge and experience of our local football. We are looking forward to working together.” “We need stability and the coach will start working with the team on Saturday.” The sacking of Italian Solinas come as no surprise after Chiefs lost three matches in four – all by 2-1 score line‚ prompting some soccer fans to dub the club “two ones”. -TimesLIVE
