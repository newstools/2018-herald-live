The Gupta brothers and former SAA chairwoman Dudu Myeni have been accused of showing an unacceptable disregard for parliament for not putting in an appearance at the state capture inquiry. The portfolio committee on public enterprises tasked with the inquiry into the mismanagement of state funds in state-owned enterprises said earlier yesterday that it expected to hear evidence from Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba‚ Myeni and the Gupta brothers. But it emerged soon afterwards that Myeni was still booked off sick and a lawyer representing the Guptas indicated that they were out of the country. “The Guptas have apparently flown the coop and are not in South Africa,” DA MP Natasha Mazzone said. “Myeni claims she is still sick – we have yet to see the original doctor’s note. “This is a flagrant abuse of the committee’s politeness and an unacceptable disregard for parliament and the constitution under which this inquiry has been established, and cannot be allowed to continue.” Mazzone said the party would request today that the Guptas and Myeni be formally summoned to appear. Should they ignore the summons‚ they would be liable to a fine or imprisonment of up to 12 months.
