On-form Bucs remain four points behind leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. “It has been a dream finish of a week where we have really taken care of all the details‚” Sredojevic said in the postmatch media conference. “I want to give credit. I stand here in front of you‚ but I want you to really see my brother Rhulani [Mokwena‚ Bucs’ assistant coach]‚ and the other members of the technical team‚ together with all the players. “We have worked very hard throughout the week. “On Tuesday, we opted for a team-building aspect and watched Black Panther. “It is a film where we as a sports brand feel represented in the historical African theme. And it has been a special injection of motivation for us to go and prove the point today,” Sredojevic said.
