Caster Semenya is looking to break Zola Budd’s 34-year-old South African 1 500m record at the final Liquid Telecom Athletix Grand Prix meet in Paarl on Thursday. Although there will be no pacemaker to assist her‚ Semenya‚ the world championship bronze medallist in this event‚ will go up against US-based Dominique Scott‚ holder of the 4min 07.25sec SA indoor record. Semenya‚ winner of the SA outdoor title at the national championships in Pretoria at the weekend‚ has already come close to the 4:01.81 Budd posted in Port Elizabeth in March 1984. Semenya went 4:01.99 at the African championships in Durban in 2016. “At SA’s it is all about the title‚ so the race is more likely to be tactical‚” Semenya said‚ referring to her 4:10.68 effort at the Tuks track on Friday night. “I am really looking forward to Zola’s record. “I have the 800m and the 1 000m record so it will be good to get the 1 500m too.” Semenya and Scott are both in great shape. With an outdoor best of 4:08.04 from last year‚ Scott has broken two national indoor records this season‚ at 1 500m and 3 000m. Meanwhile‚ Carina Horn‚ who went 11.03 to beat Evette de Klerk’s national 100m mark at the SA championships‚ has been confirmed for the Paarl meet. Her next target is the 11-second barrier. – TimesLIVE Caster runs her way to triple gold at African championship Caster Semenya bowed out of the African Athletics Championships in Durban on Sunday after winning three gold medals from two individual events and the 4x400 metres relay.
