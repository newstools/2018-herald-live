With the Ironman African Championship’s race day looming, leading Port Elizabeth triathlete Kyle Buckingham will use the Ironman 70.3 Davao, Philippines next Sunday to brush up on his leg speed. The Standard Bank Ironman African Championship is set for April 15 in Port Elizabeth and Buckingham is looking to make sure he is in prime condition for the event. Jendamark-sponsored Buckingham crossed the finish line at Pollok Beach in eight hours, eight minutes and 58 seconds last year, missing the podium by a mere minute behind Britain’s David McNamee, who came in third. This made the former Victoria Park High pupil even more motivated and with his training going ahead as planned, the 35-year-old will be out to better his result next month. The Ironman 70.3 Davao race is part of Buckingham’s preparations ahead of the big race and a good finish there could be a great confidence boost coming back home. The Ironman Sonoma County, US (Santa Rosa) 2016 winner finished ninth in Davao last year. “I’m heading to Philippines for the race on Sunday the 25th. I can’t wait to dust off the cobwebs and get some speed firing for the big one on April 15,” Buckingham said. “I did this race last year, but didn’t have a great trip and race. I hope this year will be better. The race is located in Davao, which is in a different location to last year. “I’m just going there to get some speed in the legs and do a short little pre-race prep to get the muscles firing. “The end result won’t determine my SA performance but I would like to have a great race over there. “My training has been on point. It’s such an awesome feeling when everything just gels together and you find that consistency in every session.”
