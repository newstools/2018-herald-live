The return of the enigmatic Serbian, Vladislav Heric, to Port Elizabeth as the new coach of Chippa United is indeed good news for all soccer enthusiasts. I will never forget the incredible role that Heric played when he coached Bay United in our city 10 years ago. As an avid Orlando Pirates supporter I was left stunned, at the Boet Erasmus Stadium, when Heric’s Bay United players, who were considered the underdogs in the fixture, entertained the crowd and mesmerised the Pirates defence to go on and beat my team. When the winning goal was scored the stadium erupted, and Heric ran onto the pitch, hugged his players and stole the hearts of the spectators. Since then I have followed Heric’s coaching career, and was saddened when he left our shores and made Cape Town his home base. Now that the coach has returned to our beloved city I will be supporting Chippa United as they fight to avoid relegation, except when they play the Buccaneers, because once you are a pirate you will always be a pirate! Viva coach Heric, viva Chippa United, viva Chippa Mpengesi. Long live.
