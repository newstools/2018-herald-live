Cambridge police spokesman Captain Mluleki Mbi said the 25-year-old man was charged with overloading and would appear in the East London Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday. Mbi said a vigilant Buffalo City Metro traffic officer caught the driver at Deveraux Avenue in Vincent after he grew suspicious when the driver appeared nervous while approaching the officer. “When the officer tried to stop the driver‚ he would not stop.
