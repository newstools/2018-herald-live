An unnamed Griquas rugby player has been fined R10 000 and suspended for four games after an incident at a pre-season training camp earlier this month. The player allegedly ran across a bowling green carrying an old South African flag. Initial reports said that the player‚ a white man‚ shoved the flag in the face of a black teammate. That was denied. Earlier this month Griquas president Jannie Louw confirmed to Afrikaans Sunday newspaper Rapport‚ that the player had been brandishing an old SA flag. A disciplinary hearing was held this week. Griquas said in a statement on Thursday: “After hearing evidence‚ the committee — consisting of Adv. JG van Niekerk and Adv. Thandisa Tyuthuza — was satisfied that there was proof that the player‚ although he had no intention to offend‚ acted in such a manner that it could probably have offended on the basis of race.” The player was found guilty of breaching World Rugby’s regulations and has been banned for four matches‚ suspended for two years. Of the R10 000 fine‚ half it was suspended for two years. – TimesLIVE Coach Mzwandile Stick feels team can rise to challenge in Vodacom Cup WHEN the EP Kings heard they had drawn the Kenyan Tusker Simba XV at home in their first match of the Vodacom Cup they must have viewed it as a golden opportunity to get their campaign off to… February 28, 2015 Flying wing Alshaun Bock will bring something extra special to his team in Super Rugby next year, says Southern Kings head coach Deon Davids.
