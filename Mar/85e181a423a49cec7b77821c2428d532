Maimane at the time hailed it as a landmark victory for the people of South Africa. “For too long‚ South Africans have been personally paying the extravagant legal bill of a president who – instead of leading a country – spends most of his days in court….” See the full list of parliamentary questions to Ramaphosa here.
