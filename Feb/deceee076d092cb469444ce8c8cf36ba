A jailed Indonesian druglord facing execution ran a meth-and-ecstasy ring from behind bars, police said yesterday, as officials announced his narcotics network had been smashed. A dozen people were arrested as police said they seized nearly 111kg of methamphetamine (tik) and more than 18 000 pills of ecstasy in Aceh and North Sumatra provinces. Convicted drug kingpin Togiman, also known as Toge, ran the group from prison, despite already having been sentenced to death twice for narcotics trafficking, police said, adding that the ring had links to Malaysian organised crime. “The mastermind was Togiman,” Indonesia’s anti-drugs agency spokesman Sulistiandriatmoko said. “He must have had many other accomplices. We’ll investigate this further and coordinate with international anti-narcotics agencies if needed.” Togiman, who is in his early 60s, would be charged with drug trafficking, as would the 12 arrested suspects, officials said. – AFP A Port Elizabeth police court orderly and a prison warder have been arrested for allegedly being part of a gang smuggling drugs into St Albans prison.
