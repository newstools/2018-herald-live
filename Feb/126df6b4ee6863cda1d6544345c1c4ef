   It is Valentine’s day and I thought I would help you out with a last-minute gift idea. This is perfect for the camera enthusiast in your life, especially one with a flare for fashion. I made scarf camera strap as a birthday gift for one of my closest friends quite a while ago and it she loved it so much I just had to share. To make the scarf camera strap, you will need like three things and not even a lot of patience.
You will need a scarf, key ring rings (no clue what those are called in real life) and needle and thread. How to:
You will need to look at the pictures pretty carefully to make sense of it all: 1. Put the scarf through the ring; 2. Double-knot scarf around ring (this is extremely important as cameras are expensive!); 3. Pull excess fabric through on ends; 4. Fold the excess over and into the rest of the scarf; 5. Sew the scarf to hide excess material.  6. TADAH!

It can be used on its own or to hide the original strap.
