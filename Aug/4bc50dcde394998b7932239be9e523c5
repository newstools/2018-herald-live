The victim‚ 30-year-old Constable Lonwabo Kili‚ was stationed at the Bellville South police station. “In the second incident another off duty police constable was shot twice in the head later outside the residence of a friend in Site B‚ Khayelitsha. His firearm was robbed during the incident. Constable Siyamcela Ncipa‚ aged 37‚ worked at Mowbray SAPS‚” Potelwa said. Western Cape Police Commissioner Lt-General Khombinkosi Jula expressed shock at the murders of the two police officers. Jula said the perpetrators of these two heinous crimes would be hunted down and face the full might of the law. “It is disturbing to observe that criminals have no regard for human life.
