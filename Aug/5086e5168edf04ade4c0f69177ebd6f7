A courier bakkie was hijacked in Struandale at 8.50am on Wednesday while the driver was en route to do a delivery. Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge said two men forced the driver out at gunpoint before fleeing with the bakkie. Police received a tip-off and later raided a house in Soweto-on-Sea, where they recovered at least 10 boxes of items, a television and washing machine. No-one was home at the time. Police are attempting to track down the home owner as well as the bakkie.
