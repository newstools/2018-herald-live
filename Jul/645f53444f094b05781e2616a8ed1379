Ward committee by-elections taking place in Nelson Mandela Bay on Wednesday have been marred by a protest in Motherwell, Port Elizabeth. Angry residents are believed to have disrupted voting and trashed ballot boxes. This, it is understood, is as a result of not knowing about the by-elections ahead of time. The municipalityâ€™s director of Constituency Services Dumisani Mbebe said municipal officials were trying to reason with the residents. The ward committee by-elections are being held in five wards to replace members who have either died or moved away. This is a developing story.
