Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli said that the attempted robbery happened at about 6:30pm on Thursday when two men entered the spaza shop in Vumazonke Street, Humansdorp. “One of the men pretended to be a customer and bought cigarettes.

After the scuffle, the two robbers fled on foot empty handed. “The victim was taken to hospital for treatment.” Nkohli added that a 9mm pistol, with its serial number filed off, as well as three rounds of ammunition were found at the scene. “The firearm will to be sent to the laboratory for ballistic investigation,” he added.
