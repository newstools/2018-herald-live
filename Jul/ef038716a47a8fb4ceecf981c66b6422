The Eastern Cape’s Inzolo Exclusive Game Lodge has been accredited as a five-star lodge by the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa. “We are proud to be a member of the esteemed Tourism Grading Council,” owner Paul Lynch said. “At Inzolo our vision is to provide guests with an exceptional and luxurious bush experience. Being accredited with five-star status further cements this. “Our boutique-styled lodge caters for exclusivity and intimacy, and is personalised at every step.” Overlooking a spectacular, secluded valley in the Eastern Cape bushveld, Inzolo Exclusive Game Lodge is a natural oasis with expansive plains and prolific game. Situated a stone’s throw from Sidbury village in the Albany district, it prides itself on its four well-appointed chalets, fine service and attention to detail, with a distinct sense of luxury and peace awaiting guests.
