Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spokesperson Kabelo Ledwaba said their investigators were on their way to the crash. Timothy Connor Brandt posted photographs of the airplane on the Facebook group Dutch Aviation Photographers Group. “Seen on Sunday morning at Pretoria's Wonderboom Airport‚ ex Rovos Air Convair 340 ZS-BRV‚” the caption read. According to Brandt‚ the plane was repainted in “the classic Martinair scheme for its imminent departure to its new home at the Aviodrome Lelystad in the Netherlands”. He added the airplane was set to arrive in Europe on July 23. “It is a pity that the titles have not been applied yet but I am still nevertheless ecstatic to be able to get some nice photos of this stunning old aeroplane one final time.”
