They are: ● Individual customer care service award; ● Team customer care service award; ● Individual award; ● Team award; ● Woman achiever award; ● Mentoring award; ● Leadership award; ● Innovation award; ● Administrative support award; and ● Hero’s award. Nominations close on September 30. The awards are expected to be handed out in the first week of December.
