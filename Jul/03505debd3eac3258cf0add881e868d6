A 19-year-old and 20-year-old were injured. “The two victims were standing at the corners of Fichardt Street and Kobus Road in Helenvale when a suspect armed with a firearm started shooting at someone else. During the shooting, the two innocent victims were shot.” Naidu said that the teenager was shot in the neck while the 20-year-old woman was shot in the thigh. “The suspect fled after the shooting however, they are known to police.” Asked about possible motives for the shooting, Naidu said that it was believed to involve a turf war between rival gangs in the area.
