Disgraced former SABC boss Hlaudi Motsoeneng has a brazen vision of his future: he will be South Africa’s president. Motsoeneng said he was watching the current batch of leaders – and was very underwhelmed. “The day I become the prez of South Africa‚ you’ll see real change‚” he said. “How do we allow a situation [where] small people‚ who are in parliament‚ remove Jacob Zuma? Zuma was elected by the people of South Africa‚” he said.
